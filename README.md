Portfolio website

Show each project as one page.
The project pages are as wide as the viewport and are positioned next to eachother.
Mobile first approach and a responsive design.
Swipe horizontally through projects.
One navigation with all the pages, updating when sliding.
Load pages asynchronous

Todo:
- call widget lik this: $('wrapper').swipeable({ options });
- make seperate plugin and add listener to the swipe
- use var instead of options
- modernizr checks
- navigate directly to project by hash in url
- load pages in the placeholders
- deal with short pages
