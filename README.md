Portfolio website

Show each project as one page.
The project pages are as wide as the viewport and are positioned next to eachother.
Mobile first approach and a responsive design.
Swipe horizontally through projects.
One navigation with all the pages, updating when sliding.
Load pages asynchronous

Todo:
- make seperate swipe event and add listener to the swipe
- setup archive of projects
- interval touch move to regulate firing
- make tags clickable and link to project with that same tag
